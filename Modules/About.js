                <Text>Emma isn't merely a humble keeper-of-lists. She's also quite smart!</Text>
                <Text></Text>
                <Text>She can analyze the information you provide and suggest questions for you to ask of your medical provider - just to make extra sure that your medicines are safe and effective.</Text>
                <Text></Text>
                <Text>Please don't think that Emma is second-guessing your highly educated and experienced medical provider. Her medical knowledge is far from complete, and her analytical capabilities require further refinement.</Text>
                <Text></Text>
                <Text>Despite her limitations, she feels she can still help by identifying intelligent questions for you to ask. In most cases, your doctor or pharmacist should already aware of any issues that Emma might raise, but there's no harm in asking anyway.</Text>
                <Text></Text>
                <Text>Whenever Emma suggests questions, you can ask her to email your doctor or pharmacist directly. Conventient!</Text>

                <Text>Emma stores all the information you provide to her on your phone. Therefore, this information is only as secure as your phone. It is your responsibility to keep your phone secure.</Text>

                <Text>Emma does not transmit this information anywhere else except when you ask her to open up your phone's gmail account to pre-fill the email body. Even then, you must input the email address and hit 'send' before any information is sent.</Text>
                <Text></Text>
                <Text>Emma does not communicate with external devices except when you touch the 'Update' button to update her clinical knowledge. This sends a request to pull information from a server. No health information is transmitted from your phone in this request.</Text>
